# Fillit

For this project, we get a list of multiple tetriminos that looks like this:

```
##..
#...
#...
....

..##
..##
....
....
```

The position of the tetriminos in the list has to be asigned to a letter: from "A" to "Z"

The final solution has to be the smallest square grid, containing all the tetriminos.

(Prioritizing placement to the top left of the grid, on letter ascending order)

It looks like this:
